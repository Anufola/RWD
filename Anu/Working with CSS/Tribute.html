        <h2>About My Mum</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square">
        <li>My Mum is the most loving, understanding and reasonable person I have evr met in my life, She does not impose her own ideas on people but rather she lets them choose.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Although growing up for me and my siblings was not the jolly ride we presume, the fact that someone loves us and wants to see us succesful kept us going.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            The efforts and care my mum has shown and is still showing is undescribable. She prove her love and concern to us with every oppourtunity
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Mama did not only love her children but she extends her love and generosity to friends and extended family. She gives out the little she has and her self sacrificing spirit can never be forgotten by many.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            There are always ups and downs in people's life they say, however there was a time when it only seems we are going to remain down and the end of the tunnel looks like nightfall, still we push on
        </li><br>
        <li>
            words of encouragement and motivation from the scriptures and this wonderful human shape her children's conscience and character
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Everytime I look back at the old days and see what you are o mother, i pray my God keeps protecting you even to the end of days
        </li><br>
        <li>
            I love you mama, and i keep praying that may your innermost desire gets satisfied, Thank You for everything MUM.
        </li>
        </ul>
